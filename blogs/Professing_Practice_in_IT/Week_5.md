# Week 5 - Information, Research, Estimation

## Lecture

### Information

Data $\rightarrow$ Information $\rightarrow$ Knowledge $\rightarrow$ wisdom

What level of information/knowledge is needed?
- Immediate: narrow technical
- Immediate: broader technical
- Possibilities: technical
- Possibilities: business value
- Future: what changes do I need to be aware of

Sources of information
- General
- Technical (content)
- Technical (support)
- Business
- Research

#### Information usefulness

- Reliability
- Validity
  - Different levels
    - Primary sources
    - Secondary sources
    - Expert opinion
    - Uninformed opinion
  - Evaluating sources
    - Authority of the source
    - Suitability of material
    - Sufficiency of material

#### Reference

Purpose
- Acknowledge the original source of ideas and work that is not the author's own.
- To point the reader to the original documents so that they can determine independently whether the attributed sources support the author's argument as written.
- Help identify the author;s own ideas and arguments from that of their sources

### Research

### Project Estimation

Five steps in project estimation:
- Determine the **size** of the project
- Determine the **effort** required
- Decide on the **resources** needed
- Calculate the **duration**
- Calculate the **cost**

Six approaches to project estimation
- Expert judgement
  - Advantages:
    - Relatively cheap estimation method
    - Takes relatively little time and effort
    - Can be applied early in the development cycle
    - Can be successful if experts have direct experience of similar systems
  - Disadvantages:
    - Rather subjective
    - Depends on experience and judgement
    - Cannot be used if no suitable experts available
    - Assumes experts have dealt with similar systems
    - Assumes they all have reliable data available
- Sum of the parts
  - Makes use of work breakdown structure
  - Appropriate level of granularity is important
    - too much detail takes too much time and introduce more error
    - insufficient detail means more difficult to assign tasks
- Estimation by analogy
  - Advantages:
    - Systematic, fairly fast
    - OK if sufficient historical data available
    - Can be applied early in the development cycle
  - Disadvantages
    - Have to determine set of characteristics suitable for classifying systems
    - Requires a database containing systematically maintained historical size cost data



## Reading

### [The Ultimate Guide to Project Tracking](https://www.projectcentral.com/project-tracking/)

#### What is Project Tracking

Project tracking begins early in the project with planning and goes on until the completion of a project.

Measuring project performance regularly to identify variances from the project management plan to make sure projects are on track.

#### Why Use Project Management Tracking

Four key benefits:
- Real time information
- problem identifiers
- Team motivation
- Easy and accurate reporting



#### Who Should be Involved in Project Tracking

1. Everyone working in the dark
2. Empowered teamwork

#### What are the Best Ways to Track Projects Effectively

- Plan your project before it starts
- Look for warning signs and resolve issues.
- Monitor work schedule
- Only count tasks as complete when complete
- Be realistic - actuals and estimates
- Look to the future


### [Six Reasons Why Research is Important](https://aofirs.org/articles/six-reasons-why-research-is-important)

Reasons for the importance of research:
- Acquire knowledge efficiently through research
- Research helps in problem solving
- Research provides the latest information
- Research builds credibility
- Research helps in business success
- Research discover and seize opportunities

### [Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research: What’s the Difference?](https://www.gcu.edu/blog/doctoral-journey/qualitative-vs-quantitative-research-whats-difference)

#### Qualitative Research

Qualitative research methods include gathering and interpreting non-numerical data. The following are some sources of qualitative data:
- Interviews
- Focus groups
- Documents
- Personal accounts or papers
- Cultural records
- Observation

Benefits:
- Allows for creativity, varied interpretations and flexibility.
- The scope of the research project can change as more information is gathered.

Limitations:
- More subjective, containing more personal bias.
- It ofter test on a smaller sample size.


#### Quantitative Research

Quantitative research includes compiling numerical data to test causal relationships among variables. Some forms of data collection for this type of study include:
- Experiments
- Questionnaires
- Surveys
- Database reports

Benefits:
- Produce objective data.
- Can be quickly analyzed.

Limitations:
- It cannot tailor their responses or add context.
- Requires a large data sample.

### [What are research methods](https://libguides.newcastle.edu.au/researchmethods)

#### Techniques or tools
- Qualitative
  - Interviews
  - Focus groups
  - Observations
  - Document analysis
  - Oral history or life stories
- Quantitative
  - Surveys or questionnaires
  - Observation
  - Document screening
  - Experiments

#### Mixed Methods Research

Integrate both qualitative and quantitative research. It provides a holistic approach combining and analyzing the statistical data with deeper contextualized insights.

### [Project Estimating – Analogous, Bottom-up, Parametric, three point](https://pmvidya.com/blog/project-estimating-techniques/)

Three major parts to project estimation:
- Effort estimation
- Cost estimation
- Resource estimation

#### Analogous Estimation (Top-down Estimating)

In analogous estimating, you first look for a similar project in the past, get its data, and use your expert judgement to find the approximate duration or cost for your project.

#### Bottom-up Estimating

All the components of WBS are estimated starting from bottom to the top.

If there is an activity cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence, the work within that activity is decomposed further to form more detailed activities.

The accuracy of bottom-up estimates is higher than analogous or parametric estimates. Meanwhile, it requires the maximum amount of time to estimate compared to all other estimating techniques.

#### Parametric Estimating

Parametric estimating uses project parameters along with historical data to **calculate** the cost or duration estimates.

More accurate than analogous estimates.

How to do parametric estimating?
- Regression analysis - Find the relation between two variables
- Learning curve

#### Three-point Estimating

It calculates three different estimates:
- Optimistic ($O$) - Based on best-case scenario
- Pessimistic ($P$) - Based on the worst-case scenario
- Most Likely ($M$) 

Simple Average (Triangular Distribution): 
$$E=(P+O+M)/3$$
Weighted Average (Beta Distribution):
$$E=(P+O+4M)/6$$
