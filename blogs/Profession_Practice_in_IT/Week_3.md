# Week 3
## Lecture
### Project

Project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique result.

Project development may use iterative process.

Cons:
- Vague timelines
- Inflexible planning and requirements
- Increased risk of scope creep

DevOps, agile, and ITSM are all based on iterative lifecycle.

### IT Lifecycle

#### Traditional way
Development team and operations team work in silos. Development teams focused on functionality, and non-functional requirements, whereas operations teams focus on cost, risk, security, reliability and manageability. *There seems to be an overlap between non-functional requirements and security, reliability?*

E.g. Waterfall method

### Enterprise Architecture
Enterprise architecture is a way of addressing complexity and change on a large scale.
#### TOGAF
Based on:
- Business architecture
- Data architecture
- Applications architecture
- Technical architecture

### ITSM Frameworks
### Agile Approach
Four key characteristics:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### DevOps

### [Top 6 software development models and how they influence the SDLC](https://fortegrp.com/top-software-development-models/)

SDLC | Advantages | Disadvantages | Suitable for
--- | --- | --- | ---
Iterative Model | 1. Coding starts early <br> 2. Streamlined management <br> 3. Bugs are easier to find in early stage <br> 4. Cope with requirements change in a cost-effective way | 1. Difficult to analyze risks <br> 2. Potential design and architecture issues in the later phases <br> 3. A resource heavy model <br> Too reliant on the baseline plan | 1. Large-scale projects with multiple modules <br> 2. Projects with clearly defined objectives and tasks
Agile Model (e.g. Scurm, Kanban) | 1. Easy to change Requirements and **Baseline Plan** <br> 2. Fast release of the prototype <br> 3. More communication between developers and clients <br> 4. Clients' engagement integrated in SDLC <br> 5. Continues evaluation and feedback (Correct defects in time) | 1. Difficult to estimate final costs <br> 2. Possible architecture conflicts due to constant requirement changes (Technically) | 1. Large-scale and smaller projects <br> 2. Outsourcing and managed IT services <br> 3. Adding new features to a working prototype
DevOps Model (Cooperation between Developer and Managers) | 1. Automation and optimization of processes <br> 2. Continuous feedback cycle between engineers and testers <br> 3. Streamlined product delivery <br> 4. Productivity improvements for in-house departments <br> 5. Error can be detected early in SDLC | 1. Lack of focus on documentation <br> 2. Difficult to manage emerging product features <br> 3. A challenging adoption curve | 1. Complex projects that require a lot of QA and testing <br> 2. Large teams with multiple departments
Waterfall Model | 1. Easily Manageable <br> 2. Clearly defined deliverables and milestones <br> 3. Easy to prioritize tasks | 1. Phases canâ€™t overlap <br> 2. Time-consuming (Well design at the beginning needs much time) <br> 3. Too costly to return to prior phases (Can't cope with requirements change) | 1. Smaller and mid-sized projects with clearly defined requirements
V-shaped Model | 1. Simple and straightforward <br> 2. Critical issues are taken care of during earlier phases (Combining testing with each phases) <br> 3. In-depth requirements documentation | 1. Lack of flexibility <br> 2. Too costly and time-consuming | 1. For mid-sized and large projects with explicit objectives and requirements
Spiral Model | 1. Precisely documented <br> 2. Accurate time and budget estimates <br> 3. Excellent risk assessment <br> 4. Engineers can apply changes to new iterations (Spiral) | 1. Success depends on skilled risk managers <br> 2. Requires a large resource pool <br> 3. Time-consuming | 1. Larger projects with complex requirements <br> 2. New products with multiple testing stages
