## Lecture

Cybersecurity is part of information security. Information security also focuses on physical and simulated format information, while cybersecurity does not.


### Case
#### TJX

Unauthorized access to credit card

About data:
- Need to take care with data
- Data is a saleable commodity
- Follow rules for our own protection
- Criminals are getting smarter
- Consider use of encryption

### Factors Thought to Contribute to Vulnerability

- Unpatched / Unprotected Software
- Inadequate Staff Training
- Poor Security Culture
- Misconfigured Software

### Common Cybersecurity Standards
- ISO / IEC 27001
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
  - Identify
  - Protect
  - Detect
  - Respond
  - Recover
- PCI DSS
- HIPAA




### Aspects of Security Management that are Proving to be a Challenge 
- Difficulty of changing attitudes of users to security
- Keeping up to date with threats
- Configuration management
- Lack of understanding by senior management

Malware is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software

### Five categories of security threats:
- Unintentional acts
- Natural disasters
- Technical failures
- Management failures - Ineffective procedures and controls
- Deliberate acts


### Factors Making Security Harder
- More complex systems
- Criminals becoming cleverer
- Crimes often not detected for long periods
- Wide range of users, mostly non-expert
- Management unaware of problems
- Security measures ofter inconvenient
- Costs substantial
- Benefits hard to quantify


### Business Continuity

Organization should be able to continue to function during a disaster, rather than simply trying to recover after a disaster has occurred.

- Classifying business systems
  - Critical
