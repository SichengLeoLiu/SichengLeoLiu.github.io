### Cloud Adoption
The cloud platform provide the security management method.

#### Deployment Model
- Public cloud
- Private cloud
- Community cloud
- Hybrid cloud

#### Virtualization
Multiple virtual machines run on a single physical machine by partitioning the resources of the physical machine into virtual environments.
- Bare-metal virtualization
  - Better performance
  - More complex to set up
- Hosted virtualization
  - More overhead
  - Easier to set up

#### Cloud Service Models
- IaaS
  - Application, operation system, virtual machine
- PaaS
  - Application
- SaaS
  - Client focus on data
  - e.g. Google Drive
