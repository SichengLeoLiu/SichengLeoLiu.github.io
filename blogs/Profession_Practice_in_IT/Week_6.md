### [The Difference Between Quality Assurance and Quality Control](https://www.dialog.com.au/open-dialog/the-difference-between-quality-assurance-and-quality-control/)



- Quality Assurance - QA is a strategy of prevention.
- Quality Control - QC is a strategy of detection. 

If we only apply QA, then we have a set of processes that can be applied to ensure great quality in our delivered solution, but the delivered solution itself is never actually quality-checked.

If we only focus on QC, then we are simply conducting tests without any clear vision for making our tests repeatable, for understanding and eliminating problems in testing, and for generally driving improvement into means we use to deliver our ICT solutions.

QA focuses on the process of quality, while QC focuses on the quality of output.

The results measured by QC can be used to revise the process defined in QA.

Benefits of quality management:
- Greater levels of customer satisfaction, which will very likely result in both repeat business, as well as referral business
- A motivated team that not only understand the policy objectives of the quality management plan, but who also actively participate in executing the plan
- Elimination of waste by eliminating rework arising from either the need to address bugs, or to address gaps in the solutionâ€™s ability to meet customer requirements
- Higher levels of confidence in planning, since the tasks arising from unplanned rework will fall away
- Financial rewards for the company, which are a consequence of new projects from existing and referral clients, as well as through the reduction of monies spent on rework tasks.
