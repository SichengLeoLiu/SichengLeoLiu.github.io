## Multimodal Summarization 

There are two possible ways to improve model performance on multimodal summarization task.
- Better encoding and decoding model
- Better modal fusion method

For the first method, cutting-edge models can be used to get a better performance.

For the second method, maybe I should read not only MSMO papers but also some multimodal feature fusion papers.
