### Four Foundational Concepts
- Organizations (profit or non-profit)
  - Structure
    - top down
    - networked (e.g. Alibaba)
- Value
- Organizational Value
- IT Investments
  - **Resources** refer to what an organization owns. It can be tangible or intangible.
  - **Capabilities** refer to what the organization can do by using resources.
  - Resources and capabilities can be insourced or out sourced.
  - Organizations spend more investment in transformation can perform better financially than organizations with a similar investment. (Digital leader outperform laggards)

### How is that organizational value created

#### Organizational goals

Business goals define targets an organization wants to achieve.
- It help measure progress (by providing milestones).
- It set the direction of a company.
- It establish accountability.
- It improve decision-making. (making sure the business moves to its target when making decisions)

#### Business models

Most organizations have more than one business model targeted at different customers.

#### Operating model

Operating model is the blueprint for how value will be created and delivered to stakeholders.

- How organization use their capabilities to create value.
- How organization manage itself.

Any change to organization's business model will require changes to operating model.

#### IT Strategy, IT Operating Model, IT Capabilities

IT strategy is the plane for how the organizations IT investments will be applied to achieve the organizational goals and objectives.

#### Orchestrating Business and IT Capabilities into Value Streams


# Week 3
## Lecture
Project development may use iterative process.

Cons:
- Vague timelines
- Inflexible planning and requirements
- Increased risk of scope creep

### [Top 6 software development models and how they influence the SDLC](https://fortegrp.com/top-software-development-models/)

SDLC | Advantages | Disadvantages | Suitable for
--- | --- | --- | ---
Iterative Model | 1. Coding starts early <br> 2. Streamlined management <br> 3. Bugs are easier to find in early stage <br> 4. Cope with requirements change in a cost-effective way | 1. Difficult to analyze risks <br> 2. Potential design and architecture issues in the later phases <br> 3. A resource heavy model <br> Too reliant on the baseline plan | 1. Large-scale projects with multiple modules <br> 2. Projects with clearly defined objectives and tasks
Agile Model (e.g. Scurm, Kanban) | 1. Easy to change Requirements and **Baseline Plan** <br> 2. Fast release of the prototype <br> 3. More communication between developers and clients <br> 4. Clients' engagement integrated in SDLC <br> 5. Continues evaluation and feedback (Correct defects in time) | 1. Difficult to estimate final costs <br> 2. Possible architecture conflicts due to constant requirement changes (Technically) | 1. Large-scale and smaller projects <br> 2. Outsourcing and managed IT services <br> 3. Adding new features to a working prototype
DevOps Model (Cooperation between Developer and Managers) | 1. Automation and optimization of processes <br> 2. Continuous feedback cycle between engineers and testers <br> 3. Streamlined product delivery <br> 4. Productivity improvements for in-house departments <br> 5. Error can be detected early in SDLC | 1. Lack of focus on documentation <br> 2. Difficult to manage emerging product features <br> 3. A challenging adoption curve | 1. Complex projects that require a lot of QA and testing <br> 2. Large teams with multiple departments
Waterfall Model | 1. Easily Manageable <br> 2. Clearly defined deliverables and milestones <br> 3. Easy to prioritize tasks | 1. Phases canâ€™t overlap <br> 2. Time-consuming (Well design at the beginning needs much time) <br> 3. Too costly to return to prior phases (Can't cope with requirements change) | 1. Smaller and mid-sized projects with clearly defined requirements
V-shaped Model | 1. Simple and straightforward <br> 2. Critical issues are taken care of during earlier phases (Combining testing with each phases) <br> 3. In-depth requirements documentation | 1. Lack of flexibility <br> 2. Too costly and time-consuming | 1. For mid-sized and large projects with explicit objectives and requirements
Spiral Model | 1. Precisely documented <br> 2. Accurate time and budget estimates <br> 3. Excellent risk assessment <br> 4. Engineers can apply changes to new iterations (Spiral) | 1. Success depends on skilled risk managers <br> 2. Requires a large resource pool <br> 3. Time-consuming | 1. Larger projects with complex requirements <br> 2. New products with multiple testing stages
