Hey! Here is **Sicheng (Leo) Liu (刘思成)**.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Sydney (USYD) in June 2024. During this period, I did research pathway in multimodal learning under supervision of Prof. Zhiyong Wang. Before that, I graduated from Nanchang Hangkong University (NCHU) in 2022 as an Outstanding Graduate, achieving a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I did research in semantic analysis supervied by Prof. Jian Shu

In the near future, I will begin my PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at RMIT University, where I will be working under the supervision of Dr. Estrid He and Dr. Jiao Lin.
